Creating the GeoBRU plugin profile of ISO19139

This document outlines the steps I've taken to create a GeoNetwork plugin profile of the GeoBRU profile for ISO19139.

0. In this directory

- this document ;
- the plugin profile: directory iso19139.geobru
- to load this profile on GeoNetwork startup, you need to copy the plugin profile folder (iso19139.geobru) in the plugins profile folder in GeoNetwork data folder, by default <geonetwork-installation>/web/geonetwork/WEB-INF/data/config/schema_plugins
  
1. Obtain and prepare the XSDs.

Downloaded them from 

http://staging.gis.irisnet.be/geonetwork/xml/schemas/iso19139.geobru/schema/geobru/geobruExtensions.xsd

and

http://staging.gis.irisnet.be/geonetwork/xml/schemas/iso19139.geobru/schema/geobru/geobruExtensionsServices.xsd

As there is a reference to a local copy of the gfc XSD, I downloaded that one also. Adjusted the schemalocations to be correct 
for all the local XSDs.

2. Create a profile directory and follow the steps outlined in the User Manual about how to create a plugin profile

Won't repeat the complete User Manual documentation here, but some specific points:

- created a way to recognize documents as being GeoBRU, in schema-ident.xsl
- created a GeoBRU template containing all the extension elements for datasets, based on the standard ISO19139 template for Vector metadata
- created a GeoBRU template containing all the extension elements for datasets, based on the standard Multilingual ISO19139 template for Vector metadata
- created a GeoBRU template containing all the extension elements for services, based on the standard ISO19139 template for Services metadata
- added sections in metadata-iso19139.geobru.xsl to enable the GeoNetwork editor and view to display the GeoBRU extension elements
- for the featureType element, I copied the featureType elements from the template in the ISO19110 schema directory.

3. CSW output

To preserve interoperability, changed the iso*.xsl files in /present/csw so that they convert the GeoBRU extension elements back to their
standard ISO19139 equivalents, losing the information specific to GeoBRU in the process.

To enable CSW exchange in GeoBRU profile format, added the geobru*.xsl files in /present/csw.

4. MEF export

To preserve interoperability, added /convert/to19139.xsl, which converts the GeoBRU extension elements back to their
standard ISO19139 equivalents, losing the information specific to GeoBRU in the process.

5. Localisation

Applied the provided labels.xml for French, Dutch and English. The entries for geobru:individualEmailAddress did not work, fixed them by
setting the correct context attribute. The labels for gfc:featureType are missing, so I appended the labels from the iso19110 schema to the labels file (French only),
but for some reason that doesn't work. TO DO find out. 

6. Sample metadata

Created a MEF file with sample metadata for GeoBRU.
